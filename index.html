                    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">
                        Introduced in 1933 by Dirac, who speculated on the role that the action plays in quantum mechanics and properly formulated by Feynman in 1948, Path Integrals are now a third formulation
                        of quantum mechanics. In essence they describe how all paths a particle can take contribute to the propagator describing the journey from a point to another. From field theory to statistical
                        physics, they have turned out to be a useful technique to describe systems by providing a surprisingly intuitive way of viewing quantum mechanics.

                <h2 style="color:white;">Introduction to Quantum Path Integrals</h2>
                <p style="color:white;">Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory of physics that describes the behavior of particles on a very small scale. The wave function of a quantum particle is a mathematical function that gives the probability of finding the particle at any given point in space and time. One of the central ideas of quantum mechanics is that the particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, known as superposition.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">A path integral is a way of calculating the probability of a particle moving from one point to another in quantum mechanics. It involves summing up the contributions of all possible paths the particle could take, each with its own probability amplitude. The sum of these amplitudes gives the probability of the particle being at a particular location at a particular time.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">The idea of the path integral was introduced by Richard Feynman in the 1940s as a way of calculating the probability of particle interactions in quantum field theory. The path integral formalism has since been applied to a wide range of problems in quantum mechanics, including the calculation of transition amplitudes, correlation functions, and the behavior of quantum systems in the presence of external fields.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">A quantum path integral is the sum of all possible paths taken by a particle in a given time interval. It involves integrating the probability amplitude of each path over time to obtain the probability of the particle traveling from the initial state to the final state. The path integral approach allows us to consider not just the classical path of a particle but all possible paths, including those that are highly unlikely according to classical physics.</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;">Linking Number Weighted Paths</h2>
                <p style="color:white;">Linking number weighted paths are an important concept in path integration and can be used to explain the Aharonov-Bohm effect and polymer entanglement. </p>
                <p style="color:white;">The Aharonov-Bohm effect describes the behaviour of a charged particle moving around a magnetic field. However in regions where the field is zero and should have no effect on the particle, it still does. We know that there has been an effect on the particle as it’s phase has been shifted. Particles can behave like waves and phase simply refers to where a wave is in its cycle.   </p>
                <p style="color:white;">The phase shift is determined by something called linking number. This number is how many times the particle ‘crosses’ the magnetic field lines. The paths are then weighted by their linking number.  </p>
                <p style="color:white;">To understand the concept of weighting a path, imagine that you are trying to find the probability of the particle arriving at a certain point after it has taken different paths. One way to do this is to add up the probability amplitudes of all the paths leading to the point, but some paths will contribute more to the probability than others. This is because those with complete opposite phase will cancel with each other while other will increase as they are perfectly in sync, when adding the probabilities up.   </p>
                <p style="color:white;">To account for this, we can "weight" each path by its linking number. Paths with a higher linking number are given a larger weight, while paths with a lower linking number are given a smaller weight. This allows us to properly find the probability of the particle moving from one position to another in this system.  </p>
                <p style="color:white;">A similar application is that of polymer entanglement, it has the same basic concept that each path is weighted by the linking number, only this time it’s the linking number between different polymer chains. These chains can become knotted and entangled leading to a significant change in their physical properties, by using path integration we can quantify the degree of entanglement and thereby explain these changes.   </p>

                <h2 style="color:white;">Polarons and Coupled Systems</h2>
                <p style="color:white;">If an electron moves through a polar lattice structure it distorts it by a small amount leading to a local oscillation of the lattice sites and the build up of an electric field caused by local polarisation. The polarisation gives the effect its name: Polaron. The reason for the special name the electron has while moving through the lattice site is what was originally coined “dressing”: Moving through the lattice oscillations caused by the electron swarm around it as phonons and alter its characteristics such as effective mass and mobility. </p>
                <p style="color:white;">Polarons started to be in the spotlight of research in the 1930s(L. Landau, “Uber die Bewegung der Elektronen im Kristallgitter,” Phys. Z. Soviet. 3, 664 (1933).) Various papers followed with most of them predicting results which did only match the experiments in limiting cases ( mentioned in: TD Schultz, “Slow Electrons in Crystals: Self Energy, Mass and Mobility“, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,3,(1959)). Only in the 1950s better solutions were found using path integrals showing off the capabilities of their application functioning mostly as a proof of concept.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">It is a well suited model to show off the capabilities of path integration because it can be modelled as a simplified particle interacting with a field causing harmonic oscillations around itself. From this description it comes to no surprise that path integration which has been developed partially to explain the interaction of charges with the electromagnetic field would also perform well for the polaron problem.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">But additionally to its educational value the polaron has made a reappearance in research over the past 20 years with many research papers written on their behaviour in lattice structures where they are used in research concerning photovoltaic cells (Hui Zhang and Nam-Gyu Park J. Phys. Energy 5 024002, (2023)). Parallel to this development the polaron also made its appearance in disguise. Some problems in condensed matter physics show behaviour which is similar to that of polarons allowing the model to be “recycled” for other problems (A. O. Badrutdinov, “Unidirectional Charge Transport via Ripplonic Polarons in a Three-Terminal Microchannel Device”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 126803 (2020)). The above hopefully can persuade the reader of the dual use of the polaron problem as a textbook-example and also interesting area of current research. </p>

                <p style="color:white;">Worm algorithms are a powerful tool in the field of computational physics for studying quantum systems. They are commonly used in the context of quantum path integrals, which are a mathematical technique used to calculate the probability of a quantum particle moving from one point to another.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">The basic idea behind worm algorithms is to simulate the behavior of a quantum particle by breaking down its path into smaller, discrete steps. These steps are then used to create a “worm” that can move forward or backward along the path. By manipulating the worm, physicists can calculate various properties of the system, such as the energy or momentum.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">Worm algorithms are particularly useful for studying complex quantum systems, such as those with many interacting particles. They can also be used to explore the behavior of materials under extreme conditions, such as high pressure or low temperature.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">Overall, worm algorithms offer a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of quantum systems and are a valuable addition to the computational physicist`s toolkit.</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;">Instantons</h2>
                <p style="color:white; ">Feynman’s path-integral method can be manipulated by considering ‘imaginary time’. All this means is that we substitute t in our equations, for -iT. This is known as a ‘Wick rotation’ as it can be thought of as a rotation by π/2 in the complex plane. When we do this, the potential energy term also flips to -V.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">This method allows us to find the mathematical description of instantons. They are solutions to the corresponding classical equations of motion but using imaginary time.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">Instantons are the quantum field equivalent to tunnelling, where a field ‘tunnels’ from one configuration to another even if it classically lacks enough energy. There are certain arrangements of fields that correspond to energy minima, which are separated by potential energy barriers. They can be imagined as ‘hills’ separating ‘valleys’.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">So, to change from one to another, the field would need to the energy to travel over the ‘hill’. Therefore, it shouldn’t be possible for a field to travel from one to another, but they do, and this is tunnelling. In quantum fields, this is known as ‘Instantons’, named because they describe how the field ‘instantly’ jumps between states.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">They are found in the Yang-Mills theory which explains the unification of electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces.</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;">Ideal Polymer Chains</h2>
                <p style="color:white;">Path integrals have a natural application to polymer problems as the path is exactly the polymer. As a result, the mathematics of summing up all possible paths can be more intuitively understood. The ideal polymer chain is a path of fixed length containing N monomers of a set length l. This is simpler than free particle path integral problems, where all possible paths of any length must be considered.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">The simplest approach to polymer problems is the random walk model. Each monomer is able to rotate freely in space relative to the previous one, with no preference for any orientation. Therefore the vector end to end distance can be calculated via a 3D random walk.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">Imagine tracing the path of a particle that is moving in random directions through 3D space. It will make N changes of direction, and will travel a distance l every turn. This route will be one of many possible configurations for the polymer, with the most probable configuration being the path of least action.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">The distribution function for the end-to-end distance is expressed by a path integral, from which the average and median values are found.</p>
                <p style="color:white;">The position of a polymer will also be affected by spatial obstructions, such as dust and walls. The model can be amended to include these obstructions, by adding terms to the Lagrangian according to the nature of the obstruction. </p>
                <p style="color:white;">For interactions within the polymer itself, each monomer is modeled as a small hard sphere. The volume described by this sphere is then forbidden for all other monomers. The challenge of calculating the sum of these non-interacting configurations is called the ‘excluded volume’ problem, and is unsolved.</p>

                <h2 style="color:white;">Path Integrals in Quantum Field Theory</h2>
                <p style="color:white;">Quantum Path Integrals provide arguably the most powerful formalism we have for Quantum Mechanics allowing for Lorentz covariance that previous descriptions of quantum mechanics had not been capable of. Quantum Path Integrals can account for the infinite number of paths a particle can take to travel from, say, point A to point B, as well as the infinite number of interactions that can occur on this path, storing all this information inside the integral.  </p>
                <p style="color:white;">This way of encapsulating the infinite complexity of a particle's motion can be further applied in QFT. QFT is an incredibly powerful theory combining the world of Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity, and Classical Fields Theories. Path Integrals in QFT allow us to not just sum over the infinite paths of a particle and its interactions but to instead sum over all possible geometries of the fields during the particles journey. A tool for visualising the daunting mathematics of these interactions is Feynman diagrams. These diagrams were introduced by Feynman in 1948 as a pictorial way of describing the behaviour and interactions of particles. </p>
                <p style="color:white;">The applications of QFT’s in modern physics are numerous, a specific example being in the testing of the accuracy of bound-state QED theory by G.S. Adkins, D.B. Cassidy and J. Pérez-Ríos in their research paper titled ‘Precision spectroscopy of positronium: Testing bound-state QED theory and the search for physics beyond the standard model’. QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) is a quantum field theory which describes relativistic electrodynamics. This research investigates how positronium spectroscopy can be used as an experimental test for the accuracy of the theory and how this can contribute to further research. Another current area of research for Path Integrals in QFT is, as mentioned above, Instantons. Please read this poster for further details.</p>
